            <p class="profile-description">Jeffery and Bandit are the cutest animals in the known universe. It is rumored that long ago in a time before
                time, that they were the rulers of all the lands. They ruled with compassion, mercy and love unlike anyone
                had ever ruled before. It was not until the evil lord Drakmath conjured up a wicked spell and trapped them
                in these super cute and adorable bodies. Now they live out their days providing precious love and adoration
                to all who gaze upon them.</p>
